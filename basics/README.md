### What is HTML?

- HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language and is the language for creating web pages
- It is a markup language and not a programming language
- We 'mark certain things in the code we write which tells the web browser how to structure the web page
- It does not contain any logic like conditionals or branching
- HTML consists of series of elements and each element tells the browser hoe to display the content

### HTML Element
An HTML element is the building block of an HTML document
`<tagname> Content goes here </tagname>`

Nesting of html element is possible
```
<tagname>
  <tagname> content </tagname>
</tagname>
```

### `<strong> and <em>` over `<b> and <i>`?

Though strong and bold are visually same, so is emphasis and italics but **bold and italics do not carry any semantic meaning and not good for search engine or screen reader, so stick to strong and em tag.**
